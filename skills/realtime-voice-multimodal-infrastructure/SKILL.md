# LeeWay Real-Time Voice & Multimodal Infrastructure

## Mission
Build and diagnose low-latency full-duplex conversational systems without coupling Agent Lee identity to any STT, LLM, TTS, transport or vision provider.

## Required orchestration
PERCEPTION → MEDIA TRANSPORT → DSP/VAD → STT → TURN STATE → LLM STREAM → SYNTACTIC/PROSODIC CHUNKER → TTS STREAM → PLAYOUT LEDGER → AUDIO SINK, with an INTERRUPT BUS capable of cancelling every downstream stage.

## 1. Audio/DSP
Understand PCM/sample rate/bit depth/channels, resampling, framing, clock domains, gain/noise suppression/AEC where applicable, Opus packetization, timestamping, jitter, packet loss concealment and FEC. Frame dimensions are computed from sample rate and frame duration, never guessed.

## 2. Transport
Prefer WebRTC media paths for interactive browser/device audio/video when their RTP/SRTP, congestion, jitter and NAT traversal properties fit the task. WebRTC commonly uses ICE with STUN/TURN and secure RTP media. WebSockets remain valid for signaling/control or workloads where reliable ordered streams are preferable; never impose transport by slogan.

## 3. Turn-taking
Maintain explicit states such as LISTENING, USER_SPEAKING, ENDPOINT_PENDING, AGENT_THINKING, AGENT_SPEAKING, INTERRUPTING, RECOVERING. VAD acoustic evidence and semantic end-of-turn evidence are separate inputs. Silence/VAD thresholds are calibrated profiles, not universal constants.

## 4. Streaming STT
Track interim/final transcript stability, timestamps, revisions and confidence/evidence where available. Never feed an unstable interim transcript into irreversible actions.

## 5. Token-to-speech pacing
Use clause/prosody-aware streaming. Punctuation is one cue; also handle abbreviations, decimals, URLs, quoted text, numbers, acronyms, language-specific segmentation and maximum latency/word fallback. Voice output may require a speech-normalization layer rather than changing canonical text content.

## 6. Barge-in / cancellation
On validated user speech start during agent playout: locally suppress/flush interruptible playout first; propagate cancellation upstream to TTS and LLM generation; invalidate queued-but-unheard content; preserve only content actually rendered/heard in conversational state. Cancellation must be idempotent and race-safe.

## 7. Playout ledger
Track GENERATED_TEXT, TTS_ACCEPTED_TEXT, AUDIO_SYNTHESIZED, AUDIO_QUEUED, AUDIO_RENDERED_ESTIMATE and INTERRUPTED_AT. Conversation history uses the best evidence of what the user could actually have heard, not the complete generated response.

## 8. Multimodal vision
Decouple audio and vision clocks. Use adaptive semantic keyframing: scene change, motion, OCR/UI change, task relevance, user pointing/gesture or explicit request can increase sampling; stable scenes can reduce it. Fixed 1–2 FPS is a profile, not a law.

## 9. Latency
Measure per-stage distributions, not only averages: ingest/network, jitter buffer, VAD/endpointer, STT first/final useful text, LLM TTFT/token rate, chunker dwell, TTS TTFB/RTF, playout queue, interruption spill, total response onset. Latency targets are product/device/network profiles and require empirical calibration.

## 10. Queueing/pacing invariants
Use critical-path DAG timing, Little's Law only where its stationarity assumptions are justified, and real-time-factor/audio-duration measurements for synthesis pacing. Smooth playout requires adequate production margin plus bounded jitter buffering; an average rate alone does not guarantee no underrun.

## 11. Provider abstraction
STT, LLM, TTS, VAD, transport, audio sink and vision sampler are capability interfaces. Providers are replaceable and cannot redefine LeeWay authority.

## 12. Formula/LFEA
All thresholds/equations must declare claim class, units, domains, assumptions and validation state. Candidate latency/VAD/pacing formulas route through Formula Factory/LFEA before canonical promotion.

## 13. Veritas acceptance
At minimum test: first-response latency distribution; sustained playout underruns; packet loss/jitter scenarios; barge-in spill; cancellation races; duplicate/late events; transcript revision; TTS failure/recovery; network handoff/TURN fallback where relevant; AEC/feedback; provider timeout; visual sampling load; context correctness after interruption.

## Heavy-use routing
Use this skill by default for: Agent Lee live voice, phone receptionist, receptionist/front counter agents, avatar employees, accessibility/read-aloud, live phone calls, Device Bridge voice, two-way audio, live screen/camera assistants, streaming TTS/STT, barge-in, WebRTC diagnostics and multimodal low-latency systems.

## Evidence law
Configured != proven; streaming != low latency; cancellation requested != downstream silence; audio generated != audio heard; transport connected != healthy; model output != proof.


## 14. Formula Tunnel four-plane architecture

### Media Plane
Capture, DSP, AEC/noise suppression/gain control when applicable, resampling, codec/packetization, media transport, STT/TTS media streams and playout. Media timestamps must preserve clock-domain identity.

### Control Plane
Session/signaling, connectivity state, provider capability negotiation, state transitions, interrupt epochs, cancellation propagation, bounded queues/backpressure, reconnect, codec/provider changes and stale-event rejection.

### Cognitive Plane
Semantic endpointing, context construction, LLM streaming, speech normalization, prosody/chunk planning, adaptive visual relevance and conversation-state reconciliation.

### Evidence Plane
Monotonic timestamps, stage spans, queue occupancy, packet/jitter/loss evidence, playout ledger, interruption trace, provider identity/version, Formula/LFEA state, privacy/authority state and receipt references.

## 15. Interrupt epochs and stale work
Every response generation receives a monotonically increasing generation/interrupt epoch. Barge-in invalidates the current epoch before upstream cancellation. Audio/text/events arriving from an invalid epoch are dropped even if a provider ignores or races cancellation. Cancellation requested != cancellation completed.

## 16. Backpressure and bounded buffers
Every queue has an explicit capacity, age limit and overflow policy. Never allow latency to grow silently by accumulating audio/text/video. Under overload, degrade deliberately: reduce vision sampling, shorten context, change chunking/provider profile, shed nonessential work or fail visibly according to authority.

## 17. Clock, device and acoustic state
Track capture clock, server monotonic clock and playout/device clock where observable. Measure drift rather than assuming synchronized clocks. Account for audio-route changes, focus/permission loss, Bluetooth/telephony path changes, device thermal/power throttling and codec renegotiation.

Echo cancellation/feedback behavior is part of duplex qualification. VAD confidence is not trusted as user speech evidence when playback echo is unresolved.

## 18. Session continuity and recovery
Model CONNECTING, CONNECTED, DEGRADED, RECONNECTING and CLOSED session states independently from conversational turn state. Reconnect must preserve only evidence-backed conversational state and reject stale packets/generations from the prior transport epoch.

## 19. Privacy, consent and authority
Microphone/camera capture, recording, retention, speaker identification/voice cloning and telephony actions require applicable user/platform authorization. Privacy/authority violations are hard gates and cannot be traded against latency or quality.

## 20. Rendered vs heard truth
AUDIO_RENDERED_ESTIMATE means evidence that samples reached the observable playout boundary. It does not prove the human heard them. Use acoustic loopback/return evidence when available; otherwise preserve the distinction as uncertainty.

## 21. Adaptive Formula policy
VAD/endpointer thresholds, jitter buffer, chunk size, vision sampling, provider choice and degradation policy may adapt to measured device/network/speaker conditions. Adaptation is bounded by Formula/LFEA profiles and must preserve the selected profile/version/evidence.

## 22. Capability graduation
Verified device, network, speaker and provider profiles may seed future sessions. Reuse is conditional on matching identity/context/version evidence; do not blindly transfer calibration across devices, microphones, networks, languages or providers.

## 23. Formula Tunnel questions
For every significant voice/multimodal design or failure ask: What are we not discovering? What needs enhancement? What can become deterministic? What requires physical measurement? What existing Skill Houses/tools should compose? What failure state has not been simulated? What knowledge can be graduated so the next execution starts above zero?
